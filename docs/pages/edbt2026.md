# Abstract
Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) constitutes a critical technique for integrating sensitive data across organizational boundaries without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of personal information. Over the past two decades, PPRL has evolved from simple hash-based exact matching methods to sophisticated approximate matching techniques that address the complex challenges of scalability and linkage quality.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of PPRL, organizing the relevant works in chronological order. We begin with the fundamental challenges that motivated PPRL, i.e., the legal restrictions on data sharing (e.g., GDPR), the need for approximate matching in the presence of data errors, and scalability requirements for large databases. Next, we focus on the past: we discuss the evolution of PPRL from early secure hash encoding techniques to more advanced privacy-preserving methods (e.g., secure multi-party computation, k-anonymity etc). The present section focuses on current state-of-the-art approaches that address the three main challenges of PPRL: scalability, variety and end-to-end privacy preservation. We then focus on the future, identifying critical open challenges and promising research directions. A hands-on section demonstrates the open-source software we have developed in Python for integrating the main PPRL tools. We also discuss adversary models, privacy vulnerabilities, and evaluation frameworks for assessing scalability, linkage quality, and privacy protection. We conclude with a discussion about the open challenges and promising research directions. Overall, the tutorial takes special care to synthesize theoretical foundations, current methodologies, and future research trajectories, equipping attendees with comprehensive knowledge to advance PPRL research and deploy privacy-preserving solutions in practice.

# Programme

- **Introduction and motivation**, including foundational challenges of PPRL, preliminaries on PPRL, fundamental Assumptions, principles and definitions, practical applications
- **The Past of PPRL**, focusing on encoding, blocking and matching methods
- **The Present of PPRL**, tackling bloom filter based techniques, scalable blocking techniques, filtering and acceleration methods, parallel and distributed PPRL, matching
- **The Future of PPRL**, tackling integrating Meta-blocking techniques,approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS), clustering techniques, and the experimental results
- **Evaluation Methods**, tackling adversary models, privacy attacks, privacy measures, assesing linkage quality:
  - Pairs completeness, pairs quality
  - Precision, recall, F-measure
  - Fault-tolerance to data errors
and benchmark datasets (real & synthetic)
- **Hands-on Session: PPRL tools**, we will present the state-of-the-art open-source PPRL tools
  - Anonlink
  - PRIMAT
  - Linkja
  - PPRL Toolkit
  - AMPPERE
  - **privJedAI** (our PPRL python library)
- **Challenges and Final Remarks**, including hardening techniques, best practices for secure deployment, dynamic data and real-time linking, multi-party PPRL scalability, integration with privacy-by-design, deep learning for PPRL
and conclusions.
